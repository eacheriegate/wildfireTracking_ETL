# ETL Workflow for Assessing Flood Risk using NOAA Data (New York City, NY, USA)

This project analyzes flood risk across different regions of New York City using geospatial data from NOAA. The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline gathers and processes NOAA precipitation and elevation data, followed by risk mapping and visualization of flood-prone areas in NYC.

This project serves as the foundational work from which we are expanding our investigation into ghost forest development and its environmental drivers. We are currently developing this research into a forthcoming manuscript, with details to be released upon the publication's DOI assignment.
